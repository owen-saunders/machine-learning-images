## Assignment/Workshop X (Name)

<!-- Include a brief or short description of the contents and/or expected requirements -->

In this workshop we'll be exploring the structure of [paradigms][1]. By briefly retracing their development since birth, they become clearer,
and the later steps turn out to be simpler and natural. Certain problems that seem complex at a glance are made intuitive through some crucial
understanding of their history. The foundation of knowledge improves comprehension of compounded ideas. Some of the most recent ideas utilize
concepts explored many years before their development.
